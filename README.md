- 👋 Hi, I'm Faustino, I'm in retraining in web development. I took a course in Javascript and specialized in the React library.
- 👀 I'm curious by nature and I like to understand how the things I use work (which sometimes leads me to get a little lost in the meanders of the technical docs), but I find that it's an additional challenge and I pushes me to improve my understanding of English.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript ( it is a long journey to understand this very complete language ). I'm also interested in Front-end developpement.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on everything that will allow me to improve my personal culture on the web dev in particular.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
